# Folder `resources`
This folder includes:

1. Two sample YAML files. 
     - The first defines the container app configuration required to run a single Flex Gateway replica, and 
     - The second includes a more comprehensive configuration for updating the running container app to enable ingress.


2. Examples of files created as part of the process for illustrative purposes.
