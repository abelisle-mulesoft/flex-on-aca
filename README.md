# Running Anypoint Flex Gateway on Azure Container Apps
This repository contains documentation and resources for deploying and running Anypoint Flex Gateway on Azure Container Apps (ACA).

In the current revision:
- The folder **documentation** contains an [informal guide](documentation/flex-on-aca.md) with a suggested approach to establish a baseline or foundation for deploying and running a single Flex Gateway instance on Azure Container Apps.
- The **resources** folder includes a sample YAML file that defines the container app configuration for Flex Gateway, as well as another file for updating the running container app to enable ingress. It also contains examples of files created as part of the process for illustrative purposes.
